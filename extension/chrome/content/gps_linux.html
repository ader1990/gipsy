    <h1>General</h1>
    Check that your GPS is ON and PLUGGED IN. Check that the proper port
    is marked 'enabled' in the devices list.
    Check that the device is configured to use the 'Garmin protocol'.

    <h1>Serial GPS</h1>
    Serial ports are named in Linux /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyS1 etc. for built-in 
    serial ports, /dev/ttyUSB0, /dev/ttyUSB1 etc. for USB-Serial convertors. 
    In order to access the GPS you must have proper permissions. 
    Check the permissions:
    <pre>
### Bad permissions situation
$ cat /dev/ttyS0
cat: /dev/ttyS0: Permission denied
### Correct permissions
$ cat /dev/ttyS0
[nothing_appears]->Press Ctrl-C to end the 'cat' program
    </pre>

    If you do not have correct permission set, use your configuration tool
    to add yourself correct permission. This should work on most distributions.
<pre>
#### Change to 'root' user
$ su -
Password:
#### Check the permission settings for /dev/ttyS0
# ls -l /dev/ttyS0
crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 4, 64 2007-03-23 07:56 /dev/ttyS0
#### This means that the group 'dialout' can access the device
#### Add yourself to the group 'dialout'
# usermod -a -G dialout your_user_name
</pre>
  Log out and log in again. Now you should be able to access the GPS.

  <h1>Garmin USB GPS</h1>
  There seem to be some problems with the garmin_gps driver. GiPSy supports libusb access, however
  users on Linux systems generally do not have rights to access USB devices. In order to add access, 
  create a file /etc/udev/rules.d/60-garmin.rules with the following content:
  <pre>
  SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_device",ATTR{idVendor}=="091e", MODE="0666"
  </pre>
  
  Then plug in the GPS - now you should have enough rights to access it.
